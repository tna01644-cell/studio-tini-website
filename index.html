            <p>"I’ve brought Studio Tini into my life three separate times, navigating the intense transitions from my first apartment to my family home and eventually a massive garage overhaul. Christina doesn't just 'tidy'; she systematically removes the decision fatigue and emotional overhead that had me paralyzed for months. Every time she visits, she lifts a mental weight off my shoulders that I couldn't quantify until it was gone. She has a rare gift for architectural logic paired with human empathy. She literally gives me back my time, my mental space, and my breath."</p>

            <p>"Moving from a home to a van was terrifying, but Tini saw my creative vision and built secure, logical systems that survive life on the move. We facilitated my past into the community via marketplace instead of the landfill—seeing my items make a real difference for neighbors was the closure I needed. She made the transition intentional, non-judgmental, and surprisingly fun. I feel lighter every time I drive to a new location knowing every single item is thoughtfully placed."</p>

            <p>"Tini understands asset management but with a human soul. She brought an industrial, breathable flow to my apartment that cleared my cognitive load. I now wake up in an environment that fuels my productivity rather than draining it. It’s an investment in my wellbeing; she took a space that felt like a source of distress and turned it into an aligned, high-utility, warm sanctuary. My home finally matches the speed and ambition of my professional life."</p>
